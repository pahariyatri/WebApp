Django is a free and open-source web framework written in Python that adheres to the model template view (MTV)
software architectural pattern. The MTV pattern is Django’s take on the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern.
 According to the Django Software Foundation, the model is the single definitive source of your data,
 the view describes the data that gets represented to the user via a Python callback function to a specific URL,
  and the template is how Django generates HTML dynamically.
